### Project Description:

We are recreating a basic version of the video game "Town of Salem." In the game, there is a good team (Town) and an evil team (Mafia). The Mafia try to kill the entire Town every night, while the Town tries to figure out who is in the Mafia and vote to execute them in the morning. Within each team there are special roles, such as the Town's Mayor who has more voting power and the Mafia's Godfather who has his Mafioso do the killing for him to avoid getting caught.
